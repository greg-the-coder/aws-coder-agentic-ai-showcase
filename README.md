# Data Center Investments Agent

AI-powered multi-agent system for data center sector investment analysis, built on AWS Bedrock Agents with Mistral Large 3.

A Supervisor Agent routes natural language queries to specialist sub-agents — Credit Risk, Market Analytics, and ESG Risk — each backed by Lambda action groups that query DynamoDB-stored financial data for operators such as Equinix, Digital Realty, QTS, and CyrusOne. Mock integrations for Workato (iPaaS) and Arize (LLM observability) simulate production data pipelines and monitoring without third-party dependencies.

Prompt to demo using Coder Agents:
`Analyze the Product Requirements at https://github.com/greg-the-coder/aws-coder-agentic-ai-showcase/tree/main/product-docs and create a technical design, implementation plan, and MVP demo application deployed to AWS, mocking 3rd-Party integrations with Workato and Arize.`

## Architecture

![AWS Architecture Diagram](generated-diagrams/dcai-aws-architecture.png)

The system is deployed across five tiers in **us-east-1**, each represented in the diagram above:

### Frontend — CloudFront + S3

A **CloudFront Distribution** serves the React SPA from a private **S3 Website Bucket** via Origin Access Control (OAC). CloudFront also proxies `/v1/*` and `/mock/*` requests to the API tier, giving the frontend a single domain for both static assets and API calls. The SPA itself includes four panels: Chat, Portfolio Dashboard, Workato, and Arize.

### API Layer

An **API Gateway** REST API (`/prod` stage) exposes all backend routes. Core endpoints live under `/v1/*` (query, health, sessions, reports) while mock third-party services are under `/mock/workato` and `/mock/arize`.

### Lambda Functions

Thirteen **Lambda** functions (Python 3.12) handle all compute:

- **Core API Handlers** — `query handler`, `health handler`, `sessions handler`, and `reports handler` serve the `/v1/*` routes.
- **Mock Service Handlers** — `mock Workato` and `mock Arize` simulate iPaaS and LLM observability without external dependencies.
- **Action Group Handlers** — Six functions (`credit rating`, `financial metrics`, `market data`, `ESG risk`, `generate report`, `sync Moodys`) are wired as Bedrock Agent action groups.
- **Seed** — A standalone `seed data` function populates DynamoDB with operator data for six data center companies.

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

A **Supervisor Agent** powered by Mistral Large 3 (675B) uses the Supervisor Router pattern to dispatch queries to three specialist **Sub-Agents**: Credit Risk, Market Analytics, and ESG Risk. Each sub-agent invokes its corresponding action group Lambdas and the Supervisor synthesizes cross-domain responses when needed.

### Data Layer

- **DynamoDB (7 tables)** — `sessions`, `operators`, `metrics`, `esg-profiles`, `market-data`, `traces`, and `workato-runs` store all application state with on-demand billing.
- **S3 (2 buckets)** — A Data Lake bucket for raw data and a Reports bucket for generated investment reports.
- **CloudWatch Metrics** — The mock Arize handler publishes `TraceLatency` and `TokenCount` metrics to the `DCInvestAgent` custom namespace for observability.

---

## Features

- **Bedrock AgentCore with Mistral Large 3** — Natural language investment analysis powered by a 675B parameter model via multi-agent collaboration (Supervisor Router pattern)
- **6 Action Groups** — Credit Rating lookup, Financial Metrics, Market Data, ESG Risk assessment, Report Generation, Moody's Sync
- **Mock Workato Integration** — iPaaS simulation with recipe triggering, status polling, webhook ingestion, and connection health checks
- **Mock Arize Integration** — LLM observability simulation with trace storage, evaluation metrics, latency/token tracking, and CloudWatch metric publishing
- **React Frontend** — Chat interface, portfolio dashboard, Workato panel, and Arize panel (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- **Infrastructure as Code** — 4 CDK stacks covering data, Lambda, API Gateway, and Bedrock Agent resources

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| AWS CLI | v2 | Account authentication and resource management |
| AWS CDK | >= 2.150.0 | Infrastructure deployment |
| Node.js | >= 18 | Frontend build tooling |
| Python | 3.12 | CDK stacks and Lambda runtime |
| pip | latest | Python dependency management |

You also need an AWS account with permissions for Bedrock, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudWatch, and IAM.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd aws-coder-agentic-ai-showcase

# CDK dependencies
cd infrastructure
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Bootstrap CDK (first time only)

```bash
cd infrastructure
cdk bootstrap aws://<ACCOUNT_ID>/us-east-1
```

### 3. Deploy all stacks

```bash
cd infrastructure
cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
```

This deploys four stacks in order:

| Stack | Resources |
|-------|-----------|
| `DcaiDataStack` | 7 DynamoDB tables, 2 S3 buckets |
| `DcaiLambdaStack` | API handlers, action group handlers, mock service handlers, seed function |
| `DcaiApiStack` | REST API Gateway with `/v1/*` and `/mock/*` routes |
| `DcaiAgentStack` | Bedrock Agent (Supervisor + sub-agents), action group wiring |

### 4. Seed mock data

Invoke the seed Lambda after deployment to populate DynamoDB with operator data for 6 data center companies:

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name dcai-seed --payload '{}' /dev/stdout
```

### 5. Build and serve the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build    # Production build
npm run dev      # Local dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

Set the API base URL in the frontend by creating a `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://xqh1jxcqh7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
```

## Demo Scenarios

Try these queries to exercise the agent's capabilities:

### 1. Credit Risk Analysis

```
What is the credit rating and default probability for Equinix?
```

The Supervisor routes to the Credit Risk sub-agent, which invokes `LookupCredit` and `GetFinancial` action groups to return Moody's ratings, debt-to-EBITDA, interest coverage, and probability of default.

### 2. Market Supply/Demand

```
Compare vacancy rates and pricing across Northern Virginia and Dallas data center markets.
```

Routes to the Market Analytics sub-agent, which queries `QueryMarket` for supply, demand, vacancy, construction pipeline, and pricing data.

### 3. ESG Sustainability Comparison

```
Which operator has the best PUE and renewable energy usage?
```

Routes to the ESG Risk sub-agent, which invokes `AssessESG` to compare power usage effectiveness, carbon intensity, and renewable energy sourcing across all operators.

### 4. Cross-Domain Portfolio Query

```
Give me a full investment overview for Digital Realty — credit, market position, and ESG profile.
```

The Supervisor fans out to all three sub-agents and synthesizes a unified investment brief.

### 5. Data Pipeline Trigger

```bash
# Trigger the Moody's sync recipe, then check status:
curl -X POST .../mock/workato/recipes/moodys_sync/trigger -d '{"source":"demo"}'
curl .../mock/workato/recipes/moodys_sync/status
```

## Mock Services

### Mock Workato (iPaaS Simulation)

Simulates a Workato iPaaS environment without requiring a Workato license. The mock Lambda returns realistic Workato API envelope formats so swapping in a live Workato instance is a configuration change.

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Recipe Trigger | Accepts `POST`, creates a job record in `dcai-workato-runs` DynamoDB table, returns a `job_id` |
| Status Polling | Returns mock `succeeded` status with run metrics (duration, records processed, steps) |
| Moody's Webhook | Simulates an incoming rating-action event; stores the payload in DynamoDB |
| Connection Health | Returns 4 mock connections (Moody's CreditView, AWS S3, Salesforce, Slack) with `active` status |

### Mock Arize (LLM Observability Simulation)

Simulates Arize's LLM monitoring platform without requiring an Arize account. Traces are stored in DynamoDB (`dcai-traces`) and metrics are published to CloudWatch under the `DCInvestAgent` namespace.

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Trace Ingestion | Stores trace spans in DynamoDB; publishes `TraceLatency` and `TokenCount` to CloudWatch |
| Trace Retrieval | Fetches a stored trace by ID |
| Evaluations | Returns randomized but realistic scores for relevance, faithfulness, toxicity, and latency |
| Metrics | Returns p50/p95/p99 latency, token usage, throughput, quality scores, and estimated cost |
| Dashboard | Returns time-series trace data, per-model performance, alert status, and embedding drift |

### Deployed Resources

| Resource | Identifier |
|----------|-----------|
| API Gateway | `https://xqh1jxcqh7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/` |
| Bedrock Agent | `TCAPMQHNOY` (Alias: `ISRQWCUJVT`) |

---

## Cleanup

Destroy all deployed resources:

```bash
cd infrastructure
cdk destroy --all
```

This removes all four stacks (`DcaiAgentStack`, `DcaiApiStack`, `DcaiLambdaStack`, `DcaiDataStack`) and their resources. DynamoDB tables use `DESTROY` removal policy — all data will be deleted.
